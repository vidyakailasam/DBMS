The objective is to create a database schema for a “English Premier League DB” which will be used to evaluate players’ performances. Creation of this database helps in deep-dive analysis on matches played by clubs representing various countries and their team performances. Drawing database schema produces the relationships, breakpoints and anomalies across entities to extract data.
